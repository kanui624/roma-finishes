Based off a friends business, I built Roma Finishes as a way to become familiar with React and responsive design. This was my first major project out of coding school where the entirety of our projects were done in Ruby on Rails using the MVC paradigm. Though the UI contains all filler content the application is completely responsive and has a fully functional Ruby on Rails backend API utilizing a postgresql database.

The layout and design was conceptualized and wire-framed by me and is all original. Bootstrap was used as the styling backbone of the project and was over written when necessary.

Some of the challenges that came up when building this were:

- Getting the nav bar UI to evolve fluidly on scroll
- Setting scroll markers at sections to auto scroll to when a nav option is selected
- Getting the "request a quote" input field to talk to Ruby on Rails correctly to write to the DB
- Setting up the Model and Controller for the "request a quote: field
- Setting up the error messages that trigger on the 'request a quote" input field
- Sizing the UI per device with Media Queries

This project taught me a lot about how Single Page Applications work and how to organize your application when building a backend API along with it.
